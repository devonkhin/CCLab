    <h2>Blooming Season</h2>
    <p>
      Cherry Blossoms, also known as Sakura in Japan, are the flowers of diverse cherry tree varieties. Cherry Blossom mostly bloom in spring over a season that usually lasts for two or three weeks between March and May in a year. They usually signal the end of the winter and reveal the start of the spring. However,the changes in the weather such as strong wind and rain would have an impact in the time of flowering.

    <h2>About the project</h2>
    <p>
      A generation of cherry blossoms through four seasons on p5js to connect the nature world and the technology, turning a limited nature view into something that people can enjoy infinitely by technology. This project will mainly focus on the movements of the flowers such as falling on the ground and blowing by the wind. Moreover, the generation of a cherry blossom tree through the seasons: spring, summer, fall, and winter. Most of the cherry blossoms usually bloom during the spring. The cherry blossom tree will mature with cherries during the summer. As the fall approaches, the leaves of cherry blossom trees will turn yellow and die during winter. For further investigation, I would like to investigate the visual process of the cherry blossom blomming states starting from the seeding stage until the tree dies out. The attached image below is my prototype and goal of generating a cherry blossom in the long-run with stages or life cycle of cherry blossom tree included.
