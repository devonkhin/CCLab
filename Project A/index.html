  <p> My imaginary creature is a cell that will boost one’s creativity. It moves endlessly because our brain activity is operating while we are coming up with new ideas. It is mostly activated while one is focusing on a single task. High-intensity thoughts or brain activity will keep you awake and elevated, but sustained high-intensity thoughts or brain activity will make you sleepy at a certain point. The nucleus is located in the center of the cell which is protected by the four “guardians”. The nucleus will grow larger to break through the blockade of the protection and secrete circular substances while activated. The protection will recover as soon as the Cell-C is inactivated. </p>
